## Butter Pie Crust (2)

|Amount|Ingredient|
| ---:| --- |
|1/2 c|water (cold)|
|2 T|vinegar (cold)|
|1|egg (cold)|
|2 3/4 c|flour|
|2 T|brown sugar|
|1 t|salt|
|1/2 t|baking powder|
|1 c|unsalted butter (cold)|

Table: Pie crust ingredients.

Mix liquid ingredients in a bowl - water, vinegar, and egg.
Set this bowl in a fridge to cool.
Mix dry ingredients in another bowl - flour, brown sugar, salt, and baking powder.
Cut cold butter into 1/2 inch cubes.
Use two forks to "cut in" butter into the dry ingredients.
Mix liquid ingredients into dry ingredients.

Prepare a clean, dry, flat surface.
Fold dough just 2 or 3 times on the flat surface.
Divide dough in half.
Roll each dough half into a disk, about 1 inch thick.
Place each dough disk on a plate, and cover it with a bowl on top.
Place them into fridge for at least 40 minutes, and up to 2 days.
While you wait, it is a good idea to make your pie filling.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Prepare a clean, dry, flat surface.
Sprinkle flour across the flat surface to prevent pie crust from sticking.
Roll each dough disk out to the diameter of your pie tray on the flour surface using a rolling pin (or a cup).
Form pie crusts into your pie tray.
Rolling and forming the crust can be attempted 2-3 times before you'd ruin the crust.
Bake for 20 minutes at 375 degrees F.
Bubbles often form; just poke a few holes when the crust is done to let air out.
Sprinkle sugar across the pie crust.

The pie crust is now half-cooked and is ready for filling to be added.
If you want to save this crust for later, bake it for 10-20 more minutes at 375 degrees F, until the edges are browned.
You can then refrigerate this airtight for up to 3 days or you can freeze it for up to 3 months.
